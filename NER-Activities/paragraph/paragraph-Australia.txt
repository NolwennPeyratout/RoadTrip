Nudey Beach on Fitzroy Island 
.
The Aussies have a lot of great beaches, and I haven’t visited all of them to see if Nudey is the best, but it definitely belongs somewhere near the top!
 
Nudey has a very unspoiled feel to it, and even on an overcast day the views in the distance were really nice.
Since it’s off the mainland, it doesn’t seem to get too crowded either. The name is a misnomer by the way, it’s not a nude beach.
Actually, this island is part of the Great Barrier Reef. But what’s really special here is the clean white sand, boulders, and turquoise water.
  
It’s FREE to visit Fitzroy Island or Nudey Beach.
There’s no entry fee aside from the cost of the ferry ride to the island.
  
Fitzroy Island is located in Queensland, Australia, just 29 kilometers (18 miles) southeast of the city of Cairns, which is home to Cairns International Airport (CNS). You can 
 at Skyscanner.
From Cairns, you can 
, or you can camp or 
. The ferry ride to Fitzroy Island only takes 45 minutes from Cairns and costs $80 AUD roundtrip.
From the resort and arrival area at the jetty, it’s just a 20 minute hike (one way) to get to the beach. The path to the beach is well marked, paved, and pretty flat for the most part.
Enjoy!
