After a bunch of visits to Japan over the years, I’ve put together this Kyoto temple & shrine guide to help you find the best ones!
Kyoto is Japan’s ancient capital and cultural center, so it has a lot of the most famous shrines in Japan, and there are a bunch of must see temples in Kyoto too.
There are actually more than 2,000 temples and shrines in Kyoto, so it can be tough to decide which ones to visit. Read on for my complete Kyoto temple guide!
 
The Kinkaku-ji Temple (also known as the Golden Pavilion) is one of the most iconic and famous places in Japan.
It’s the #1 most visited Kyoto temple, and for pretty good reason! It’s almost impossible to take a bad photo here! This is definitely one of the best temples in Kyoto.
A good time to visit is in the morning before the wind picks up, then you can see reflections on the pond. Sadly when we went it was very windy, so no reflections.
The 
 probably takes the cake for the nicest looking Kyoto temple.
After you visit the Golden Pavilion, you might like to know that it also has a less famous twin called Ginkaku-ji, the Silver Pavilion! This one is located in eastern Kyoto (Higashiyama), but it’s not too hard to reach.
Also known as the Higashiyama Jisho-ji, this temple dates back to the 15th century, when it was originally built as a mountain villa for the shoguns. 
It’s a beautiful building in its own way, and very photogenic, with a dry sand garden and raised cone that looks like Mount Fuji.
  
This temple was built in the 14th century and it’s located in Kyoto’s Arashiyama district. 
It has a nice landscape garden and incredible fall colors if you come near the middle of November. The garden is the main reason this one made my list of the best temples in Kyoto.
Tenryu-ji also borders the famous Arashiyama Bamboo Grove, so chances are you’ll be near it anyway if you’re visiting the top tourist sites of west Kyoto.
       
  
  
This is an 8th century Kyoto shrine with more than 1,000 orange torii gates surrounded by forest.
It’s fun to wander around the maze of gates and there are some nice mountain trails too.
This place can get very crowded with tourists though, so it’s best to come in the early morning or late afternoon.
Bright orange Torii gates at Fushimi Inari, one of the most famous traditional shrines in Kyoto Japan.
This is probably Japan’s most celebrated temple, and it’s a great place to see fall colors too.
Most people take pictures of the main building, but our favorite part was actually the orange pagoda next to it. In any case, there are loads of good photo ops all around this Kyoto temple!
Kiyomizu-dera is a Buddhist temple that was built in eastern Kyoto in the 8th century.
The photogenic orange pagoda at Kiyomizu-dera Temple
It’s impossible to visit the Higashiyama district in Kyoto without seeing this iconic pagoda sticking out above the rest of the buildings.
The Yasaka Pagoda has 5 stories and even though it was built in the 15th century, it’s part of a temple that dates back to the 6th century.
The best photos are on the outside, of course, but you can also go inside (up to the 2nd floor of the pagoda) for a fee.
Yasaka Pagoda in the Higashiyama ward
This is a random temple we passed while strolling through the Higashiyama area of Kyoto.
We didn’t know anything about it at the time, but it turns out this is actually considered one of the most important Zen temples in Kyoto. Founded in 1202 AD, it’s also believed to be the oldest Zen temple in Kyoto.
The white and black colors are nice for pictures.
Kennin-ji Temple
This is an underrated temple located in Uji, a small city between Kyoto and Nara. It’s very easy to visit from Kyoto.
Byodo-in Temple was originally built in the 11th century, and today it’s even featured on the Japanese 10 yen coin.
The surprising thing is that Byodo-in Temple 
 that looks just like it and shares the same name! 
Byodoin Temple strangely has a twin building in Hawaii that looks just like it.
Todai-ji Temple is one of Japan’s biggest and most spectacular landmarks. Even though it’s outside of Kyoto, you can still visit it easily from there.
This massive ancient monument has a lot of cool history behind it. It was the world’s biggest wooden building for a millennium, and it houses the biggest bronze Buddha statue in the world.
We’ve visited Todai-ji a couple of times and it’s a must-see. If you look around the Nara Park, it also has a bunch of other traditional Japanese temples and shrines.
Nara is super easy to visit on a day trip from Kyoto or Osaka, so you should definitely add it to your Japan bucket list!
After being finished in the 8th century, the 
 was the biggest wooden building in the world for more than 1,000 years.
Here’s a Kyoto temple map you can use to plan your Japan trip. You can click the icons to get more info and directions for each point of interest, but keep in mind some of the locations on this map may be approximate.
For more detailed information on how to get to the Kyoto temples on this map, you can check out my individual travel guides for each location.
  
Most traditional shrines and temples in Kyoto Japan are open to tourists, but there are a few basic rules and things to know:
       
  
  
Kyoto temples and shrines are especially spectacular in the autumn and cherry blossom seasons, but that’s also when they’re the most crowded.
The timing for these seasons is different every year, but you can generally see the sakura season (cherry blossoms) in the last week of March, and fall colors peak around mid November (for the Kyoto area).
Generally the best time of day to visit is early in the morning and late in the afternoon, because the temples can get extremely crowded by midday, especially during holidays and peak seasons.
At any of the temples with ponds (like 
), you’ll want to be there early in the morning anyway to capture the reflections on the pond before the wind picks up.

After a bunch of visits to Japan over the years, I’ve put together this Japanese temple & shrine guide to help you find the best ones!
There are more than 160,000 traditional Japanese temples and shrines scattered across the ‘Land of the Rising Sun,’ and usually they have a bunch of interesting history behind them, plus the buildings themselves are real works of art.
Kyoto is Japan’s ancient capital and cultural center, so it has most of the famous shrines in Japan, as well as many of the best temples to visit in Japan. You can also find some good ones in and around Tokyo city.
Read on for my complete Japanese temple guide!

Sensoji is the biggest and most popular temple in Tokyo. It’s also the oldest, since it was built in the 7th century.
If you only visit one traditional Japanese temple during your time in Tokyo, this is the one to see! On the outside, it has a 5-story pagoda and a giant paper lantern that’s popular for photos.
Sensoji also happens to be a great place for souvenir shopping. We found lots of great stuff in the street shops surrounding the temple.
 is the oldest and most popular temple in Tokyo
Kawasaki Daishi is one of the nicer temples in the Tokyo area, in Kawasaki City.
It may not be quite as big and famous as the one at Sensoji, but it’s worth a stop if you’re looking for more things to see in Tokyo.
This one was originally built in the 12th century, but it was mostly destroyed in World War II. Even though the current building is a reconstruction, it’s still pretty impressive and looks authentic.
Kawasaki is more than just a motorcycle brand
This is a hill temple and Japanese shrine in Kamakura that may date back to the 8th century.
There are lots of interesting statues at this one, including a 9-meter tall Kannon figure that is one of the biggest wooden statues in Japan. At the top, there’s a viewpoint where you can look out over the city and see Sagami Bay in the distance.
Hase-Dera is very close to the famous Great Buddha statue in Kamakura, so you can easily visit both in the same day.
Quirky little praying statues at Hase-Dera Temple
The Fuji Five Lakes area is spectacular and you can visit it on a day trip from Tokyo. Mount Fuji is the highest peak in Japan, and it’s also one of the country’s most beloved icons.
Among other things, the Arakura Sengen shrine at Fuji is home to the picturesque Chureito Pagoda, which was added to the complex in 1963 as a peace memorial.
Chureito is a beautiful red 5-story pagoda that you can photograph with Mount Fuji in the background, and it’s easily one of the most recognizable Japanese shrines and temples you’ll ever see in pictures!
 
This is an 8th century Japanese shrine in south Kyoto with more than 1,000 orange torii gates surrounded by forest.
It’s fun to wander around the maze of gates and there are some nice mountain trails too.
This place can get very crowded with tourists though, so it’s best to come in the early morning or late afternoon.

The giant Buddha statue at Kamakura is one of Japan’s most famous landmarks.
This bronze statue is part of the Kotoku-in temple, but it sits in the open air ever since a tsunami washed away the main building in the 15th century.
Kamakura is one of the closest day trips you can take from Tokyo since it’s just 1 hour south of the Tokyo city center.

It’s hard to make a list of the best things to do in Japan, because there are just so many cool and fun activities in this country.
Every island in Japan is interesting, but many of the best tourist sights and activities for a first timer are in the cities of Osaka, Kyoto, and 
.
There’s a huge variety of cultural attractions here, both old and new. You can ride a futuristic bullet train through the city and then explore an ancient temple or Samurai castle in the same day.
We’ve visited Japan a bunch of times over the years, but it never gets old. It’s one of our favorite countries in the world to travel.
Read on for some of our top ideas of what to do in Japan!
 
Japan has lots of castles left over from its medieval period, when Samurai warriors ruled the land. These fortresses are impressive works of art and they can be fascinating to explore.
There are a bunch of these Samurai castles scattered across the country, but two of the top ones to see are 
 (near Osaka and Kyoto) and 
 (near Tokyo).
This is hands down one of the best things to do in Japan, and it’s pretty budget friendly!
 is the biggest and best samurai castle in Japan. It’s easy to visit from Osaka or Kyoto!
 is a black and white Samurai castle you can see on a day trip from Tokyo.
There are lots of kimono rental shops in Japan where you can try on the country’s famous traditional dress for a day. 
My wife rented a kimono in Tokyo and we headed over to the famous Shibuya Crossing — perfect photo spot! We also did a kimono rental in Kyoto, which is loaded with great photo spots because of all the temples and shrines.
If you ask the locals, they aren’t offended at all by foreigners wearing the kimono. It’s a popular tourist activity here, and Japanese people like to see others enjoying their culture.
Intan had a blast doing the Kimono rental in Kyoto. Bali’s samurai woman!

Japanese gardens are famously pristine and photogenic. There are lots of them all over Japan, and they’re great for a relaxing walk.
The gardens are nice year round, but they’re especially scenic when the fall colors start (usually in November). It’s one of our favorite activities in Japan.
The pictures below are from the garden at Tenryu-ji Temple in Kyoto.

As you may already know, tea is a big deal in Japan, so it can be a fun cultural experience to join a Japanese tea ceremony!
This is an important traditional ceremony that takes place on a tatami (floor mat), and a lot of preparation goes into it. The tea ceremony is full of artistic detail. For Japanese people, it’s meant to represent purity, tranquility, respect, and harmony.
Even if you’re not really a tea lover, it’s a good dose of Japanese culture and history. Some places also let you rent a kimono to wear as an add-on, making the experience even more immersive and unique.
 
It’s always fun to travel by train, and Japan has some of the world’s coolest trains. They’re very efficient, and some of the rural routes can be incredibly scenic.
The futuristic bullet trains in Japan are called ‘shinkansen’ and they’re especially fun to ride since they can go hundreds of kilometers per hour. ​You can ride these in Kyoto, Osaka, Tokyo, and many other places in Japan.
If you buy a Japan Rail Pass (also known as 
) you can enjoy unlimited rides on JR trains for one, two, or three weeks. This can be a very cost effective way to do long distance train travel in Japan!
Faster than a speeding bullet!
A lot of the famous landmarks of Japan can be seen in the three popular cities of Osaka, Kyoto, and Tokyo.
Some of the coolest iconic sights include the Arashiyama Bamboo Grove (Kyoto), 
 (Nara), and the giant Kamakura Buddha (Tokyo).
Don’t forget natural landmarks like Mount Fuji and Lake Kawaguchi, which are possible to visit on a long day trip from Tokyo!
The famous giant Buddha statue at Kamakura is easy to visit from Tokyo
 is one of Japan’s best landmarks, and you can see it on a day trip from Osaka or Kyoto.
Japan is full of ancient temples and shrines, and they’re as interesting as they are photogenic.
A lot of the best ones are in the Kyoto area in my opinion, but every island in Japan has unique temples with their own nice designs and history.
A few of our top recommendations would be 
 (Tokyo), 
 (Kyoto), and the Fushimi Inari Shrine (Kyoto).
 is the oldest and most popular temple in Tokyo
 (also called the Golden Pavilion) probably takes the cake for the nicest looking temple in Japan.
It’s hard to beat the autumn season in Japan, when the leaves turn into bright colors of orange, red, pink, and yellow.
The best time to see fall foliage in Japan depends on where you’re going, but for Kyoto and Tokyo it generally peaks in mid to late November. The locals call the fall leaf colors ‘koyo’ and they can be really stunning.
This is one of the best free activities in Japan!

Trees on fire
If there’s anything more popular than the autumn colors in Japan, it’s the sakura season.
The cherry blossoms are very photogenic and you can see them at a lot of Japan’s famous sights like 
, Mount Fuji, and others.
The exact dates for this depend on the year and which part of the country you’re in, but generally the best viewing is in the last week of March. It’s a must do activity!
 
The Nara Deer Park is famous for having hundreds of friendly deer you can feed and take pictures with. The semi-wild deer roam around the park freely and interacting with them can be lots of fun.
Also scattered around the 1,600-acre park are a bunch of old temples and shrines from hundreds of years ago, when Nara was the ancient capital of Japan. It’s one of the best things to do in Japan.
You can easily visit the Nara Park on a day trip from Osaka or Kyoto since they’re just a 30-60 minute train ride apart!
You can interact with friendly deer at the

One of the best winter day trips you can do from Tokyo is to visit the Snow Monkey Park near Nagano. 
This is a long day trip if you’re coming from Tokyo, so ideally it’s better to do as a 2 day trip, but you get to hang out with Japanese snow monkeys in the mountains and watch them soak in the natural hot springs!
The monkeys are hilarious to watch, and photo ops are endless. It’s great for kids. There’s a bit of easy hiking required, but the snowy views along the way are one of the best things about the trip.
The 
 are a blast!
Snowy mountain village at Nagano
As the highest peak in Japan, Mount Fuji is also one of the country’s most beloved icons. You’ll see it on postcard photos, souvenirs, and artwork all over Japan, and you should see the mountain with your own eyes too!
The Fuji Five Lakes area is spectacular and you can visit it on a day trip from Tokyo. Prime photo spots include the scenic lakes and the Chureito Pagoda, which is a picturesque 5-story red pagoda you can photograph with Mount Fuji in the background.
Long ago, Fuji used to be an active volcano, but it hasn’t erupted for hundreds of years (since 1707). If you enjoy hiking, you can also climb Mount Fuji! The trail is beginner friendly, but also challenging enough to be a good workout.
 
Finished in 2012, the Tokyo Skytree is the tallest structure in Japan, and the tallest tower in the world. With a height of 634 meters (2,080 feet), it’s currently the third tallest structure in the world, after the Merdeka 118 in Malaysia and the Burj Khalifa in Dubai.
You can take an elevator up to the observation decks in the Skytree, where you’ll have amazing panoramic views of Tokyo city from above. If you’re feeling brave, one section even has a glass floor where you can look straight down.
The Tokyo Skytree is open to the public 365 days a year, generally from 10 AM to 9 PM. A night time visit can also be interesting if you want to see the Tokyo city lights after dark. All in all, the Skytree is definitely one of the best things to do in Japan!
 
Of course you can’t leave Japan without doing some souvenir shopping.
There’s the usual assortment of fridge magnets and keychains, or you can bring home an artsy paper fan, ceramic bowl, kimono, or a cool Japanese knife.
The Shinjuku and Shibuya districts in Tokyo are some of the best for shopping, but we also found some great souvenirs in places we didn’t expect it, like the street stalls at Sensoji Temple.

Where to begin? Japan is famous for its amazing food. Just eating is a good enough reason to come to this country.
You have to try the Ramen, Sushi, Udon, Yakitori, and everything else Japan is known for. Even the food in 7-Eleven and other convenience stores is top notch. All in all, enjoying the food is one of the best things to do in Japan.
Osaka is generally regarded as the top food city in Japan, and places like Tokyo and Kobe are also world famous for their cuisine. Tokyo has the most Michelin Star restaurants of any city in the world, with more than 200!

Japanese candy is just as interesting as the food — stuff like Mochi and Daifuku might weird you out at first, but after awhile it really grows on you!
There are also sweet snacks to try, like Pocky and Melon Pan, plus reinvented western snacks like Kit Kat. 
Japan is obsessed with Kit Kats, so there are more than 300 unique flavors to be found in the country, including things like peach, cheesecake, sake, and matcha (green tea).
If you fall in love with Japanese snacks, there are subscription services on the internet such as 
, where you can have a box of unique Japanese snacks sent to you every month!

There’s a matcha (green tea) flavor of absolutely everything in Japan.
The Dotonbori district is one of Osaka’s main tourism hotspots, and it really comes alive at night.
This place is loaded with good restaurants, food stalls, bars and cafes, and interesting sights. It’s one of the best things to do in Japan.
We spent many nights at Dotonbori and barely scratched the surface. It’s pretty much a foodie paradise!
Welcome to Osaka!
Famous electronic billboards at the Dotonbori riverside
The Shibuya Crossing in Tokyo is famous as the busiest pedestrian crossing in the world — as many as 3,000 people cross the intersection at a time! 
It’s fun to watch the sea of people crossing the street, especially on a weekend. This also happens to be a great area for shopping or eating, so you’ll want to stick around.
Don’t forget to check out the Hachiko dog statue next to the Shibuya Crossing. It commemorates the sad story of a loyal dog that always waited at the train station every day for his owner, Professor Ueno, and continued the daily routine for nine years after his owner passed away. The faithful dog eventually died and was buried with his owner in 1935.
For a birds-eye view of the Shibuya Crossing, head over to the nearby Hikarie skyscraper, where you can take an elevator up to the 16th floor sky lobby and look out over the city from above.
Shibuya is the world’s busiest pedestrian crossing
A ryokan is a type of traditional Japanese inn with tatami floor mats, sliding doors, and a futon bed on the floor. It’s a classy design that often features an exceptional Japanese breakfast, and onsen hot springs you can enjoy as well.
Ryokan have been a thing in Japan since ancient times (as early as 700 AD!), although nowadays modern style hotels have largely replaced them in the big cities. There is still high demand for onsen, but they tend to be quite a bit more pricey than other hotels in Japan.
You can still find some beautiful 
, but the options are pricey and somewhat limited. Generally you can get a better 
 or other parts of Japan!

Taking a cooking class in Japan can be a fun way to learn how to cook the typical Japanese dishes of a bento box, including sushi, tempura, teriyaki chicken, and miso soup.
GetYourGuide has a bunch of different high-rated cooking classes to choose from, especially in Tokyo and Kyoto. Normally the way these work is that you’ll spend about 3 hours learning how to cook Japanese food, plus you’ll hear a little bit of the cultural background behind each of the dishes as you go.
You can do a private class with a local chef, or join a group class (which is usually cheaper). They provide all of the ingredients, apron, and utensils, and at the end of the cooking class you get to eat the Japanese meal you’ve prepared!
 
No Japan trip would be complete without a visit to the Samurai museum in Tokyo. You can see swords, armor, helmets, guns, and more historical stuff here.
The entrance fee is a little on the high side, but it includes a free guided tour in English, and the exhibits are cool to see. After the tour you can get your photo snapped wearing a Samurai helmet, or you can even wear a full Samurai costume if you want!
Unfortunately this museum has been closed ever since the covid pandemic disrupted travel, but hopefully it will reopen again soon!

Saké is a popular Japanese alcoholic drink made from fermented rice, with about 15 percent alcohol content. The name is pronounced ‘sah-kee’ or ‘sak-ay’ and you can find it in bars and restaurants all over the Japanese islands!
Saké tasting can be a fun experience, and GetYourGuide has a bunch of different high-rated activities where you can do this, especially in the Kyoto area. Generally they let you sample a bunch of different styles of saké, and then explain some of the history and traditions behind the drink.
To top it off, there are hundreds of historic saké breweries in Japan, so it can be fun to tour a brewery as well and get a sense of what goes into the production of this popular Japanese drink!

Tokyo Japan is commonly rated the world’s #1 city for travel, and there are so many things to do.
Even though it’s the largest metro area in the world, it’s also one of the safest and easiest to get around, thanks to Japan’s convenient rail system.
Here’s our list of some of the best things to do in Tokyo Japan! Most of these are free or can be done on a pretty modest budget!
No Tokyo trip would be complete without a visit to the Samurai museum in Shinjuku. You can see swords, armor, helmets, guns, and more historical stuff here.
The entrance fee is a little on the high side, but it includes a free guided tour in English. After the tour you can get your photo snapped wearing a Samurai helmet, or you can even wear a full Samurai costume if you want!
Unfortunately this museum has been closed ever since the covid pandemic disrupted travel, but hopefully it will reopen again soon!
  
  
The Shinjuku district is a good place to try some Japanese eats. One of the most famous spots is the Omoide Yokocho alleyway, where you can find all kinds of grilled meat skewers and other things in a laid back ‘street food’ type setting.
  
  
The Shibuya Crossing is famous as the busiest pedestrian crossing in the world — as many as 3,000 people cross the intersection at a time! 
It’s fun to watch the sea of people crossing the street, especially on a weekend. This also happens to be a great area for shopping or eating, so you’ll want to stick around.
Shibuya is the world’s busiest pedestrian crossing
This is the major electronics district of Tokyo. You can find anything related to electronics here, but it especially caters to anime/manga and video gaming. The SEGA and Nintendo retro game shops here are fun to explore.
  
  
As you may already know, tea is a big deal in Japan, and it can be a fun cultural experience to join a Japanese tea ceremony!
This is an important traditional ceremony that takes place on a tatami (floor mat), and a lot of preparation goes into it. The tea ceremony is full of artistic detail. For Japanese people, it’s meant to represent purity, tranquility, respect, and harmony.

Of course you can’t leave Tokyo without doing some souvenir shopping.
There’s the usual assortment of fridge magnets and keychains, or you can bring home an artsy paper fan, ceramic bowl, kimono, or Japanese knife.
The Shinjuku and Shibuya districts are two of the best for shopping, but we also found some great souvenirs in places we didn’t expect it, like the street stalls at Sensoji Temple.

It’s always fun to travel by train, and Japan has some of the best. The trains here are very efficient and some of the rural routes can be incredibly scenic.
Japan’s futuristic bullet trains are called ‘shinkansen’ and they’re especially fun to ride since they can go hundreds of kilometers per hour. You can ride these on the JR East and JR Central lines near Tokyo.
If you buy a Japan Rail Pass (also known as 
) you can enjoy unlimited rides on JR trains for one, two, or three weeks. This can be a very cost effective way to do long distance train travel in Japan!
Faster than a speeding bullet!
The Skytree is the tallest tower in the world, and the 2nd tallest building in the world (after the Burj Khalifa in Dubai). From the top of this tower you can get some great views of the Tokyo cityscape.
  
  
Sensoji is the biggest and most popular temple in Tokyo. It’s also the oldest, since it was built in the 7th century.
If you only visit one Japanese temple during your time in Tokyo, this is the one to see! On the outside, it has a 5-story pagoda and a giant paper lantern that’s popular for photos.
Sensoji also happens to be a great place for souvenir shopping. We found lots of great stuff in the street shops surrounding the temple.
All in all, Sensoji was one of our favorite things to do in Tokyo.

Kawasaki Daishi is one of the nicer temples in the Tokyo area, in Kawasaki City.
It may not be quite as big and famous as the one at Sensoji, but it’s worth a stop if you’re looking for more things to see in Tokyo.
This one was originally built in the 12th century, but it was mostly destroyed in World War II. Even though the current building is a reconstruction, it’s still pretty impressive and looks authentic.
Kawasaki is more than just a motorcycle brand
There are lots of kimono rental shops in Japan where you can rent the country’s famous traditional dress for a day. 
My wife rented a kimono in Tokyo and we headed over to the famous Shibuya Crossing — perfect photo spot!
If you ask the locals, they aren’t offended at all by foreigners wearing the kimono. Japanese people like to see others enjoying their culture.

As the highest peak in Japan, Mount Fuji is also one of the country’s most beloved icons. You’ll see it on postcard photos, souvenirs, and artwork all over Japan, and you should see the mountain with your own eyes too!
The Fuji area is spectacular and you can visit it on a day trip from Tokyo. Prime photo spots include the scenic lakes and the Chureito Pagoda, which is a picturesque 5-story pagoda you can photograph with Mount Fuji in the background.
Long ago Fuji used to be an active volcano, but it hasn’t erupted for hundreds of years (since 1707). If you enjoy hiking, you can also climb Mount Fuji! The trail is beginner friendly, but also challenging enough to be a good workout.
 
Kamakura is one of the closest day trips you can take from Tokyo since it’s just 1 hour south of the Tokyo city center. Some top tourist sights here are Hasedera Temple and the giant Buddha statue at Kotoku-in.

Japan has lots of Samurai castles left over from its medieval period. These fortresses are impressive works of art and they can be fascinating to explore.
If you run out of things to do in Tokyo city, Matsumoto is an awesome black and white castle that you can visit on a day trip from Tokyo. 
This is one of Japan’s top 3 Samurai castles, along with Himeji and Kumamoto.

One of the best winter day trips you can do from Tokyo is to visit the Snow Monkey Park near Nagano. 
This is a long day trip (ideally it’s better to do as a 2 day trip), but you get to hang out with Japanese snow monkeys in the mountains and watch them soak in the natural hot springs. 
The monkeys are hilarious to watch, and photo ops are endless. There’s a bit of easy hiking required, but the snowy view along the way is one of the best parts of the trip.
The Japanese snow monkeys are a blast!
Thanks for looking! I hope you enjoyed this list of some of the best things to do in Tokyo Japan.
