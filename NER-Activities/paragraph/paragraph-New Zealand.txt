The Tongariro Crossing is one of the biggest and best day hikes in New Zealand.
Mars-like volcanic peaks and smoking craters may not be the first thing you had in mind for your trip to NZ, but the epic factor on this one is off the charts.
If these apocalyptic landscapes look like something right out of ‘Mordor’ in the Lord of the Rings movies, that’s because all of those scenes were filmed here!
Definitely try to fit this hike into your New Zealand itinerary! This travel guide will explain how to get there, and everything you need to know before you go!
  
Tongariro National Park is 
.
The nearest town is Turangi, which is about a 20 minute drive from the park, or a 4 hour drive from Auckland or Wellington.
  
The mountains of Tongariro are considered sacred in the local Maori culture, and it became New Zealand’s first national park in 1894.
In the 1990s, the park was 
 because of its outstanding natural and cultural value.
More recently, one of the big volcanic peaks in the park (Mount Ngauruhoe), was used as the filming location for Mount Doom in the famous ‘Lord of the Rings’ movies.
Nowadays, the trail is hiked by more than 150,000 people per year!
  
  
 
  
The Tongariro Crossing is a difficult point-to-point hike that takes most of a day to complete.
You’ll hike through an active volcanic area with smoking heat vents, petrified lava rocks, and giant volcanic craters. The last significant eruption was in 2012. Of course, volcanic activity here is constantly monitored, but there’s no safety guarantee.
Don’t let any of this put you off, because it’s probably one of the coolest hikes in the world! That’s also why it does get a little crowded, especially on weekends.
We did the crossing on a cool summer day and it wasn’t as hard as we expected. Ok, there were a couple moments where we felt like Frodo and Sam trudging wearily through Mordor, but it was manageable and behind every hill we climbed was a rewarding new view.
Just come prepared. Bring lots of water and a jacket for the top of the mountain. Toilets are conveniently placed every 1-2 hours along the trail.
  
 
 
  
  
 – 1 hour
This section is flat and well maintained. You’ll walk past mounds of volcanic rocks and a marshy sulfur stream, with early views of the ‘Mount Doom’ volcano. 
Near the end is a small waterfall called Soda Springs that you can walk up close to.
  
 – 40 to 60 minutes
Climb the ‘Devil’s Staircase’ up to the South Crater. This is one of the steeper sections of the trail, so take your time.
  
 – 1 hour
This section starts out as a flat walk for about 15 minutes, then it’s 30+ minutes of steep ascent to the Red Crater Ridge (pictured above). 
It’s windy here and the gravel can be slippery, so keep your distance from the edge and proceed carefully.
  
  
 
  
  
 – 30 to 60 minutes
Prepare your camera and snacks, because this is the most scenic part of the hike by far! Behind you is the ‘Mount Doom’ volcano, to your right is the Red Crater, and below you are the three bright green Emerald Lakes.
The scree on the way down to Emerald Lakes is very slippery. This part is fun. You can almost surf down it on your feet! Just roll with it (no pun) and maybe turn sideways for better balance. 
After you reach the Emerald Lakes, it’s a flat walk and then a short uphill ascent to Blue Lake.
  
 – 1 hour
There’s a short ascent to the edge of the North Crater, and then from here, just go down, down, down! The trail is well maintained all the way and never gets too steep. 
On a clear day you’ll get amazing views of the plains and Lake Rotoaira in the distance.
  
 – 2 hours
The end section is the most boring part of the trail. Just keep going down, down, down into the trees, and then the trail will flatten out as you follow another sulfuric stream through the forest. 
You’ll emerge into a small parking lot (not the one where you started), and then follow this for the remaining 1 km back to 
 where your vehicle is waiting for you. Done!
  
  
 
  
  
 
 
  
This is a point to point hike, so the process can be a little confusing at first.
You’ll need to park your car at 
 and then have a shuttle take you to the start of the hike at Mangatepopo.
That way, once you hike across the mountain and arrive back at Ketetahi, your car will be waiting for you and you can leave immediately.
  
You’ll need a shuttle to take you from the car park over to the starting trailhead on the opposite side of the mountain. This is required. The one way shuttle rides leave at 5:30, 6:30, 7:30, 8:30, and 9:30 AM, and the ride takes 30-45 minutes.
 or directly with one of the shuttle companies (there are several). It costs about $40 NZD ($28 USD) per person and I would recommend booking at least a few days in advance if possible. 
The other option is to book a 
, which is more pricey but includes transport, lunch, and a guide to help you along for the full hike.
 
The best time to do the Tongariro Crossing is from November to April.
Even in these months, it’s a good idea to keep an eye on any DOC weather advisories, because the trail is sometimes closed because of cruddy weather conditions.
During New Zealand’s winter (from May to October), the trail is covered with snow and ice, and it can be dangerous. Don’t attempt it during these months unless 
.
  
  
The night before your hike, you’ll ideally want to stay as close to the Tongariro National Park as possible.
You can stay at one of the comfy holiday parks in Turangi, or there several free campgrounds in the nearby Kaimanawa Forest Park:
These are all very basic DOC campgrounds with drop toilets, no showers, etc. You can find more info on each in 
.
We decided to stay at a free campground (
) the night before the hike, and then 
 the night after. That way we had a nice hot shower and other camping facilities waiting for us after the hike.
Regardless of whether you decide to stay in Turangi or Kaimanawa, either area is just a 20-30 minute drive from the national park. Perfect!

The Roys Peak hike is one of the most well known day hikes in south island New Zealand.
This tough trail on the outskirts of Mount Aspiring National Park rewards you with almost fjord-like views of Lake Wanaka and the surrounding landscape.
If you’re passing through the Wanaka area and looking for a challenge, don’t miss this hike! This travel guide will explain how to get there, and everything you need to know before you go!
       
  
 
The Roys Peak trail is 
 of New Zealand, just outside of the town of Wanaka.
The trailhead is a 70 minute drive from Queenstown, or just 10 minutes from Wanaka.
  
 
  
The Roys Peak hike is a strenuous out-and-back trail, and 90% of your time will be spent walking uphill or downhill. It’s a calf/knee/ankle killer. You’ve been warned!
Is it worth it? I think so, but once is enough. We wouldn’t do this hike a second time. As you climb the switchbacks, your first views will be of Lake Wanaka and the farmlands behind you, with the lake and mountains becoming more expansive as you go.
Along the way, you’ll have the occasional sheep (and lots of hikers) to keep you company.
  
 
  
 Finally, you step out onto a long flat ridge with incredible panoramic views of Lake Wanaka, Glendhu Bay, and the mountain ranges on both sides.
  
 Regardless of how we felt about the exhausting hike up until now, this view really bowled us over.
  
 
  
 With a good zoom lens, you could capture some really stunning pics here.
  
 Like most hikers, we decided to stop here at the lookout point and not go to the top peak. Reason being, if you go to the peak it’s another steep slog with 1,000+ feet (300 m) of extra elevation gain.
  
 More importantly, the general consensus is that this spot has the best views anyway!
  
 
  
There’s no entrance fee, but they do ask for a voluntary $2 NZD donation at the start of the hike.
  
  
  
There are several holiday parks in the Wanaka area if you need a place to camp:
More info on each of these can be found in the handy 
 app.
Wanaka also has 
, but this is a touristy lakeside town so things are not exactly cheap.
Unfortunately there aren’t any free campgrounds in the Wanaka area 
.

New Zealand is a wonderful country for a road trip, especially on the mostly rural South Island, where 
.
This country has two main islands, and both are worth visiting. The North Island has great beaches, volcanoes, and green farmlands, while the South Island has glaciers, fjords, rain forests, and arguably the best road tripping conditions and overall scenery.
Last, but not least, New Zealand is where the entire 
 movie series was filmed, and 
. That gives it bonus cool points.
Read through this complete New Zealand travel guide for more info on what to expect!
English
Christianity
Wellington
Visa free access (with ETA) for many nationalities
Temperate; summer is Dec - Feb
The main airport in New Zealand is Auckland (AKL) on the North Island, which has lots of direct flights from countries all over the world. On the South Island, the biggest airport is Christchurch (CHC). There are also smaller airports in Wellington, Queenstown, and Dunedin. 
You can 
 on Skyscanner.
New Zealand is one of the safest countries in the world, with a low violent crime rate of 
 (90% lower than the global average). Theft from vehicles does happen occasionally and you'll see signs warning about this in parking lots, so remember to always lock up and keep your valuables with you.
The climate in New Zealand is temperate and mild, so there's seasonal variation in temperatures, but nothing very extreme. Spring and Summer in NZ are from September to November, and December to February, respectively. 
Summer daytime temps hover around 24 C° (75 °F), and winter 13 °C (55 °F), with spring and autumn temps being between those ranges. Winter in NZ is from June to August.
New Zealand is not a cheap country. You can expect to pay over $2 New Zealand Dollars per liter for gas (that's a liter, not a gallon)! Eating out isn't cheap either, with casual restaurants costing upwards of $20 NZD ($12 USD) for a meal. 
The good news is that you'll pay a fraction of this when cooking your own meals. Camper van rentals are not exactly cheap either, but you can cut costs by looking for free/low cost campgrounds. The handy 
 app is great for this.

The Tasman Glacier Walk may be a little less popular than the nearby 
, but they both have amazing views and they’re super easy to add to a New Zealand itinerary!
At the end of the Tasman Glacier view track, you get top notch views of Tasman Lake, formed by New Zealand’s biggest glacier, as well as the Blue Lakes.
It’s one of the top treks in Mount Cook National Park. This travel guide will explain how to get there, and everything you need to know before you go!
  
  
Tasman Glacier is located on the South Island of New Zealand, in Mount Cook National Park.
The trailhead 
, just 15 minutes from Mount Cook Village, and there’s generally plenty of parking space.
From Christchurch, it’s a 4 hour drive on mostly rural roads to get to the national park.
  
  
It’s an uphill climb to Tasman Glacier view point, but I would rate the trek as super easy. You can reach the top in just 20 minutes or less.
Near the halfway point, there’s a detour to visit the Blue Lakes, a pair of small glacier lakes that changed colors after they were named. These lakes used to be turquoise in the 1800s, but nowadays they’re only fed by rainwater so they’ve turned green. 
If you branch off and visit the Blue Lakes too, the hike will take about 1 hour return without counting photo stops.
  
 
  
  
 You’ll want to take lots of pictures on the Tasman Glacier Walk, because the viewpoint at the top gives great panoramic views of Tasman Lake, small icebergs, the lower glacier (which is retreating), Blue Lakes, and the surrounding mountains.
  
 Tasman Glacier is the longest glacier in New Zealand. As of 2017, it’s 23 km long, although it’s shrinking rapidly. In 1890, it was 29 km long and there was 880-meter deep ice here.
  
 There’s a separate (short) trail to go to the base of Tasman Lake, and I’ve heard it’s even more scenic than the top viewpoint. Sadly we missed that one because we were in a hurry. Next time!
  
  
 
       
  
  
FREE as of 2020.
No fees or permits are needed for the Tasman Glacier view track.
  
The best place to camp is at the nearby 
.
The 
 and some other great trails start directly from this campground, and it also has flush toilets and filtered water for dishwashing. It doesn’t have showers, but those can be had at 
.
It’s a little overpriced at $15 NZD (~$9 USD) per person, but you’re paying for the amazing views and location. More info can be found in the handy 
 app.

The Hooker Valley Track is one of the best short walks in New Zealand.
It’s a flat, easy hike with amazing views of some of the best lakes and peaks in Mount Cook National Park.
This is the kind of scenery that made New Zealand a perfect setting for the Lord of the Rings movies!
       
  
 
Hooker Valley is located on the South Island of New Zealand, in Mount Cook National Park.
The trailhead 
, which also happens to be a great place to stay the night. 
From Christchurch, it’s a 4 hour drive on mostly rural roads to get to the national park.
  
  
 
       
  
This is a short out-and-back trail that takes you over bridges and past glaciers, lakes, and mountain ranges.
During the hike you’ll have constant views of Mount Sefton, accompanied by the sound of its rumbling glaciers, and if you’re lucky you may even witness an avalanche or two in the distance (we did!).
There are good photo ops at every turn, and the trail never gets steep or tiring. I’d rate it as easy and suitable for everyone.
  
 
  
  
 Even though it may be a beginner friendly hike, the visual payoffs are anything but ordinary. These are amazing landscapes that are always changing. 
A plaque at Mueller Lake tells about this:
  
A hundred years ago, the Mueller Glacier filled the valley floor. You could have walked onto the glacier from near here. Today, the glacier is all but hidden up the valley. Glacial ice left behind is still visible at the far end of the lake. Piles of rock rubble (moraine) dropped by the glacier mark its past extent.
 
 As you round the corner, your next sight will be Mount Cook, the tallest mountain in New Zealand, and each step takes you closer to this giant.
  
 The hike ends on a little ‘beach’ with a stunning view of Hooker Lake with its floating icebergs. Hold a piece of iceberg for a unique New Zealand memory!
  
 
  
FREE as of 2020.
No fees or permits are needed for this hike.

The Devil’s Punchbowl Waterfall is a short walk in Arthur’s Pass, New Zealand that rewards you with a nice waterfall.
The falls are impressive and easy to reach. Don’t drive through Arthur’s Pass without making a quick detour for this trek!
 
The Devil’s Punchbowl Waterfall is located in Arthur’s Pass, on the South Island of New Zealand.
 and there’s a dedicated car park with plenty of space.
If you’re starting from Christchurch, it’s a 2 hour drive to Devil’s Punchbowl Falls.
  
The hike to Devil’s Punchbowl Waterfall is a short and steep climb through a beech forest, with about 200 steps, but I’d rate it as easy. You can reach the falls in less than 30 minutes.
There’s a platform for viewing the falls from the creek, or you can take the path all the way up to the base of the falls (recommended) for an even better look.
It’s a great waterfall at 130 meters tall (425 feet), and it has a strong flow all year round. The best time for photos is in the morning around 9-10 AM, before the sun is too high.
When we did this trek in February, there were only a few other hikers on the trail. There’s also a decent chance of seeing Kea or Kiwi birds.
A lot of South Island itineraries go through Arthur’s Pass on the way back to Christchurch, so this is an easy hike to add onto the itinerary!
  
FREE as of 2020.
No fees or permits are needed for Devil’s Punchbowl Falls. Enjoy!
