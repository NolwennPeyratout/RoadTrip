Egypt is full of 'bucket list' experiences. The most famous of these would easily be the 
 near the capital city of Cairo, but there are also some other 'must see' sights in central and southern Egypt.
Top sights in my opinion would have to include the archaeological museums and temples of Luxor, and the incredible pharaoh statues and ancient tombs at

As a tourist, your main airports in Egypt will be Cairo (CAI), Hurghada (HRG), and Sharm El Sheikh (SSH). Cairo has lots of direct flights from countries around the world. There are also smaller airports in Luxor (LXR) and Aswan (ASW). You can 
 on Skyscanner.
Egypt has struggled with some safety issues over the years, but the situation seems to be improving. Even so, I'd recommend avoiding crowds and practicing situational awareness; terrorist attacks have occurred near some popular tourist areas in Egypt. 
The other thing to note is that Egyptian culture is conservative, so clothing in public should be modest.
The climate of Egypt is arid, so it's hot and dry year round. The coolest months are from December to March, and this is probably the most popular time to visit, but honestly any month in the spring or fall would also be fine. 
I visited Egypt in September, and the heat was bad at times in Luxor, but I didn't think it was too much of a problem in Cairo. Egypt is not as hot as nearby Middle Eastern countries like

Egypt is a budget friendly travel destination, with 
. With that said, your money won't go as far here as it will in Southeast Asia. Meals in Egypt are about 150 to 300 pounds depending on location. 
Transportation is generally by car or train, and these are very affordable. You can use taxi apps like Uber and

Egypt isn’t just about the pyramids. If you do some exploring, you’ll find it’s a country loaded with ancient temples, colossal statues, archaeological museums, and more.
I spent two weeks solo traveling Egypt in 2018, and I was floored by how many of these amazing places are still intact. Every day was a new adventure.
This is not a complete list of every interesting thing to see (that would be impossible!), but just some top highlights. This is a lineup of the very best things to do in Egypt!
Of course — the pyramids! You can’t make a list of the best things to do in Egypt and not include these wonders from 2560 BC. 
The Great Pyramids of Giza are just a 30 minute drive from the city of Cairo. This is undoubtedly one of the most beautiful places in 
.
  
  
The giant sphinx of Giza, with its lion shaped body and pharaoh head, is right up there with the pyramids in fame and splendor.
It’s just a short walk from the pyramids, and it’s included in the same ticket, so you can easily visit both on the same day!
  
  
Riding camels is a popular activity in Egypt (and elsewhere in north Africa and the Middle East), and what better place to get your picture snapped than on a camel in front of the great pyramids?
The camels are friendly and it only costs about 50 EGP (~$3 USD) to go for a 30 minute ride around the pyramids.
  
  
Egypt’s most complete museum is home to more than 120,000 artifacts, including King Tut’s gold mask and other fascinating antiques from ancient Egyptian history.
This museum is currently being moved from Cairo to a huge new building at Giza (as of 2020), but the contents will stay the same!
  
  
The easiest Egyptian temple to visit in Luxor is —you guessed it— Luxor Temple.
These temple ruins from 1400 BC are located smack dab in the middle of Luxor city, just a short distance from the airport and hotels.
  
  
Karnak was one of ancient Egypt’s grandest and most important temples.
Even today, it’s one of the biggest religious buildings in the world, with still intact statues, obelisks, and a hypostyle hall that features absolutely massive pillars.
This one is on the northern outskirts of Luxor, just a short drive from town!
  
  
This canyon on the west bank of the Nile river was the main burial place for ancient Egypt’s pharaohs and nobles, including King Tut.
Valley of the Kings is easy to reach from Luxor. It’s worth visiting for the history alone! And the walls in the tombs are loaded with interesting hieroglyphs.
  
  
Aside from being one of the most photogenic places in Egypt, this epic tomb is also famous for being dedicated to Egypt’s first female pharaoh.
It’s located on the west bank of Luxor, right across from the Valley of the Kings.
  
  
These were two giant statues that used to guard the tomb of King Amenhotep III, near the Valley of the Queens.
The main tomb was destroyed in an earthquake in 1200 BC, but the statues still remain!
  
  
This is another West Bank temple near Luxor.
Madinat Habu is easy to visit in conjunction with Memnon and the Valley of the Queens, and in my opinion it has some of the best inscriptions in any of the Luxor temples!
  
  
Philae is a Nubian temple that was moved to a small island to protect it from flooding.
This is one of the great temples in southern Egypt, and it’s only a short distance from Aswan, so don’t miss it if you’re exploring that area!
  
  
This is another Nubian temple relocated to a small island near the Aswan dam.
Kalabsha is easy to reach from Aswan, and the painted reliefs inside the main temple are top notch.
  
  
Last but not least, there’s Abu Simbel, an incredible temple with huge sitting pharaoh statues. It’s in the far southern part of Egypt, near the Sudan border.
Abu Simbel was one of my favorite places I went in Egypt. It’s a bit harder to reach than the others, but the hassle is absolutely worth it!
  
Thanks for looking! I hope you enjoyed this list of some of the best things to do in Egypt.

Thanks for this great list! I visited Egypt at the beginning of this year for 6 weeks and it became my favorite holiday destination. It is such a beautiful country. The history, culture, friendly people,… Everything just fits.

The Colossi of Memnon are two giant statues of Pharaoh Amenhotep III that sit near Luxor, Egypt.
There’s some cool history behind these impressive monuments, and they’re super easy to combine with nearby tourist sites like Valley of the Queens or 
.
The Colossi of Memnon were two giant statues that used to guard the tomb of King Amenhotep III, near the Valley of the Queens. This former temple was once the biggest in the world, even bigger than 
.
The statues were built in 1350 BC, and stand about 20 meters (60 feet) tall. The main tomb was destroyed in an earthquake in 1200 BC, but the statues still remain!
The statues weigh about 650 metric tons each, and you can get some great pics of them with the mountains and desert in the background.
There may not be a whole lot else to see here, but it’s still a very worthwhile stop!
  
  
FREE as of 2020.
No ticket or entrance fee is needed.
  
  
The Colossi of Memnon statues are 
, on the outskirts of Luxor, Egypt.
The Cairo International Airport (CAI) has 1 hour direct flights to the Luxor airport (LXR) for around $90 USD or less, or you can take a 9 hour day train for around $10 or so. You can 
 at Skyscanner.
Once you’re in Luxor, it’s easy to find a driver to take you to the Colossi and other sites on the west bank, or your hotel can usually arrange this as well.
  
If you would rather go with a vetted tour company and skip the hassle of arranging everything yourself, there are several companies that offer tours to the Colossi and other Luxor sights.
Here is a

, Valley of the Kings/

We’ve used this company for lots of tours and activities around the world, and they’re great. Highly recommended!

The Karnak Temple complex in Luxor is one of Egypt’s biggest and most famous ancient buildings (especially the temple of Amun).
Karnak was a huge religious monument built by many pharaohs over the course of 1,500 years of history, and even today you can still see a lot of the original statues, columns, and hieroglyphs in amazing condition.
Construction of the Karnak Temple complex started more than 4,000 years ago (around 2,055 BC) and continued for almost a millennium until the Romans took over Egypt in the late years BC.
Karnak was a place of worship built to honor Egyptian gods like Amun and Osiris. Off and on, Egyptian rulers kept adding new buildings over the centuries, making it even bigger and more impressive as time went on.
It became an important temple city and one of the biggest religious buildings anywhere in the world (although the 
 in 
 beats it out for total size). 
Karnak began to decline after the city of Thebes (now Luxor) was sacked by the Romans in the 1st century AD.
Today, Karnak is one of the most visited archaeological sites in Egypt, after 
.
  
  
Karnak is a huge temple complex covering more than 80 hectares (200 acres), so there’s lots to see here.
Fake guides will insist on showing you ‘photo spots’ or inscriptions to look at, but then demand a tip (baksheesh). Just ignore them or politely say you’re not interested. It’s all part of the Egypt experience.
All in all, if you’re an Egyptian history lover you could spend hours exploring Karnak, but because of the Luxor heat I whisked through in about 1 hour. 
Come early in the day if you want to avoid the worst of the heat!
  
  
Some of the best statues and sphinxes can be found near the entrance, in the Great Court between the first and second pylons. There’s a towering figure of Ramesses II and rows of small ram-headed sphinxes.
Don’t miss the hieroglyphs and giant obelisks either. One of these is the tallest obelisk still standing anywhere in the world.
But the highlight of the whole temple for me was the Hypostyle Hall, which is the biggest room of its kind on Earth. Dozens of these huge columns are still standing, and walking through the hall makes you feel like a dwarf.
  
*If you buy the Luxor Pass, this is one of the temples included in the pass.
       
  
  
Karnak Temple is 
, in the city of Luxor, Egypt.
The Cairo International Airport (CAI) has 1 hour direct flights to the Luxor airport (LXR) for around $90 USD or less, or you can take a 9 hour day train for around $10 or so. You can 
 at Skyscanner.
Once you’re in Luxor, it’s easy to find a driver to take you to Karnak and back. It’s a bit far to walk from the town center, especially with the Luxor heat and rabid touts.
  
If you would rather go with a vetted tour company and skip the hassle of arranging everything yourself, there are several companies that offer tours to Karnak and other temples in Luxor.

The Abu Simbel Temple in Egypt may not be as well known as 
, but it was easily one of my favorite travel experiences ever.
This is an incredible ancient temple, thousands of years old, located in a remote corner of Egypt near the border of Sudan.
Walking around these colossal pharaoh statues carved into the side of the rock feels a bit like you’re wandering back in time, or maybe you’ve just stepped into an Indiana Jones movie.
The Abu Simbel temples were built in 1244 BC and they’re dedicated to Pharaoh Ramses II and Queen Nefertari. There’s a big temple for Ramses, and a smaller one for Nefertari.
The point of this monument was to celebrate King Rameses II’s victory over the Hittites at the Battle of Kadesh in 1274 BC, which was believed to be one of the largest chariot battles in history.
The temples were rediscovered by a Swiss explorer in 1813, but they had been buried by sand and no one was able to find an entrance until it was excavated in 1817 (how cool is that?).
The entire temples had to be moved in 1968 as part of a huge project by 
 to save them from being flooded and destroyed by Lake Nasser.
Today they sit on the west bank of the lake, but everything else looks exactly how it did 3,000 years ago.
  
  
This one is a bit of a hassle to visit since it’s in a remote location, but I think it’s really worth it for such an epic experience.
Abu Simbel is actually the name of a small village in southern Egypt, close to the Sudan border, and the temples are just a 15 minute walk from the village.
To get to Abu Simbel, first you have to get to Aswan, a different town.
EgyptAir and Air Cairo run flights from Cairo International Airport (CAI) to Aswan International Airport (ASW) that cost anywhere from $50 to $100 USD, one way. You can 
 at Skyscanner.
From Aswan, you can either drive or fly to Abu Simbel, depending on how long you plan to stay. See the full explanations below for more info.
  
  
The most popular way to visit Abu Simbel is on a day trip from Aswan with a tour group. There are 
 in this manner.
The road distance is about 280 kilometers (175 miles) and the drive takes 3.5 hours each way, for a total of 7-8 hours of driving.
It’s a hassle, but again, there is no way to visit Abu Simbel without some hassle.
 
If you’d like to stay a night in Abu Simbel to visit the night show (which is great, I’ll give more detail on that later), then the best option is to fly.
Sadly the only airline route to Abu Simbel Airport (ABS) is from Aswan International Airport (ASW), so you can’t fly directly from Cairo.
From Aswan to Abu Simbel, it’s a 45 minute flight with EgyptAir for $80 (one way). You can 
 at Skyscanner.
If you’re not interested in the night show, then definitely skip the flying and take a day tour by car instead (as above).
It’s more time in transit, but it’s much cheaper and you won’t miss anything.
  
  
After you arrive in Abu Simbel, the temples are just a 5-10 minute walk from the parking lot, or a 15 minute walk from Abu Simbel village.
You’ll want to bring water, and 
 the souvenir shops on this street at all costs. Don’t even look at them. These were some of the most aggressive and crazy sellers I encountered in my 2 weeks in Egypt, which is saying a lot.
One of the sellers followed me for 100 meters and sounded like he was going to attack me when I didn’t buy his souvenirs.
Just ignore them completely and keep walking. I made the mistake of looking interested in one of the fridge magnets!
  
The ticket price for Abu Simbel is 160 EGP ($9 USD) as of 2018. This gives you entry to both temples.
If you want to take photos inside the temples, you have to buy an extra ticket for 300 EGP (~$18).
Neither of these are cheap by Egyptian standards, but you can skip the photo ticket if you don’t want to take pictures inside.
I would recommend skipping it unless you consider yourself a photographer. The temples are amazing on the inside, but they’re dim and hard to photograph.
If you do buy the photo ticket, remember to keep it handy for later on when the guards ask to see it, because they will definitely ask if they see you taking photos inside.
  
 As you walk down the hill, you will see the two temples about 100 meters apart.
  
 There’s a big temple for Ramses, and a smaller one for Nefertari.
  
 If you get here around noonish, you might even have the place to yourself.
  
 
  
  
The main temple is the biggest and most impressive of the two temples at Abu Simbel, and it took almost 20 years to build. It’s easily the highlight of coming here.
The temple is dedicated to King Ramses II, and you can see his likeness on the huge 20 meter (70 foot) tall pharaoh statues sitting in front.
One of these statues is headless because it fell apart in an earthquake.
  
 The size of these statues is incredible, but you don’t really realize it until you get up close.
  
 Huge heads and legs. The scale is just massive, and you feel tiny.
  
 All of this was carved out of the rock, thousands of years ago.
  
 
  
You can go inside the Great Temple, and there’s no extra charge for this. It’s very worthwhile.
There’s a sign by the door of the temple saying you can’t take photos inside, but if you bought the photo pass mentioned earlier then you can ignore this and click-click away.
Just remember to keep your photo pass handy for when the guards ask to see it, because they will definitely ask.
  
 The first thing you see on the inside is a row of statues with their arms crossed, which is supposedly meant to represent either Ramses II as a deity or possibly Osiris, an Egyptian god of the underworld.
  
 
  
 Most of the carvings on the inside show different scenes from the Battle of Kadesh, and there’s one huge picture of a chariot in battle. Awesome!
  
 
  
  
Located just 100 meters from the main Abu Simbel temple is a second one dedicated to the Egyptian queen Nefertari. This one is not as huge and impressive as the main temple, but it’s still pretty cool in its own way.
The front of the temple has a row of 6 statues of the king and queen, along with some mini-statues of the princes and princesses.
The 6 main statues are over 10 meters tall, so they’re bigger than they look in pictures!
  
 This facade is also covered with cool hieroglyphics carved into the rock — pictures of moons, birds, dragonflies, beetles, and other weird shapes.
  
 You’ll see a sign by the door again saying you can’t take photos inside, but if you bought the photo pass mentioned earlier then you can ignore this and go ahead.
  
 
  
The inside of Abu Simbel temple #2 is interesting too.
It has 6 square pillars and the walls are covered with Egyptian deities and royal figures.
The dark corners of the room are artificially lit, so if you bought the photo pass earlier then you can try to take some neat pictures.
  
 The wall on your right (as you enter) shows King Ramses II smiting an enemy of the Egyptians, while the queen watches.
  
 
  
The biggest reason to stay a night in Abu Simbel village is to see the Sound & Light show at the temples after dark.
Every famous place in Egypt has a night show like this where they light up the monuments with a projector and tell stories about their history.
The show at Abu Simbel temple starts at 7 PM and lasts about 45 minutes. The price is normally 150 EGP (~$9) per person, but the show only runs if there are at least 7 tickets bought.
That means if there are less than 7 people attending, you’ll need to pay extra to make up the difference.
  
 I was asked to pay 250 EGP, but it turned out there was a group of at least 20 people (I didn’t find this out until I walked down the hill and joined them), so in retrospect I was overcharged by almost double. This type of scamming is pretty typical in Egypt.
  
 The narration for the show is done in whatever language most of the visitors speak (my group was mostly Spanish), but you also get ear buds to listen in your own language.
  
 
  
 I really debated whether I wanted to stay a night in Abu Simbel village just to see the night show, because the airfare and other costs start to add up.
  
 But it seemed popular and the pictures looked great, so I decided to go for it.
  
 These shows range from gimmicky to amazing, but Abu Simbel falls in the amazing category. It’s pretty much known as the best Sound & Light show in Egypt.
  
 The only thing more amazing than seeing these huge statues in the day time, was seeing them lit up at night while listening to stories from their ancient history.
  
 It was the highlight of my trip to Egypt, and probably one of the best travel moments I’ve had anywhere in the world.
  
 
  
  
If you do decide to stay a night in Abu Simbel, there are not a lot of options for accommodation. Your best bet is probably 
.
The facilities were nothing spectacular, but the WiFi was pretty good, and most importantly the hotel is only a 5-10 minute walk from the temples.
Egypt has an arid climate, so it’s hot and dry year round.
The coolest months are from December to March, and this is probably the most popular time to visit Abu Simbel, but honestly any month in the spring or fall would also be fine.
I visited Egypt in September, and the heat was bad at times, but I didn’t think it was too much of a problem at Abu Simbel.
Even at its worst, Egypt is not nearly as hot as some nearby Middle Eastern countries like Qatar or the United Arab Emirates.
  
 
Dear Sirs your documentation on Abu Simbel is just fantastic. In the sixties I participated on several seasons at the ancient site of Gebel Adda, which was on the east side of the Nile and some 4 kilometers south of Abu Simbel. At Abu Simbel I took many photographs and at the moment I am busy writing a small report of my time in Nubia. Now may I ask you a question?
 At Abu Simbel, between the left statue and the bedrock, I noticed a Tomb which belonged to an English soldier. Would you be able to find out the Name of this person. I would be very gratefull if you could help me in this matter. In my paper on Nubia I would of course mention also your Name. Thank you very much in advance yours Reinhard Huber.
Hi Reinhard, thanks for your message. Unfortunately I haven’t been able to find out who that tomb belongs to. If I’m able to get any more information, I will share it here. Thanks!
Dear David thank you very much for your mail.
 In case you find out the name of the tomb owner I will mention your name in my publikation. Have a nice day.
 Reinhard
